# Configuration file for Synapse.

## Server ##

# The domain name of the server, with optional explicit port.  This is used by
# remote servers to connect to this server, e.g. matrix.org, localhost:8080,
# etc.  This is also the last part of your UserID.
#
server_name: \"$(primary_ip)\"

# When running as a daemon, the file to store the pid in
#
pid_file: /usr/local/synapse/homeserver.pid

# The absolute URL to the web client which /_matrix/client will redirect
# to if 'webclient' is configured under the 'listeners' configuration.
#
web_client_location: https://$(primary_ip)/riot

# The public-facing base URL that clients use to access this HS (not including
# _matrix/...). This is the same URL a user would enter into the 'custom HS URL'
# field on their client. If you use synapse with a reverse proxy, this should be
# the URL to reach synapse via the proxy.
#
public_baseurl: https://$(primary_ip)/

# If set to 'true', removes the need for authentication to access the server's
# public rooms directory through the client API, meaning that anyone can query
# the room directory. Defaults to 'false'.
#
#allow_public_rooms_without_auth: true

# If set to 'true', allows any other homeserver to fetch the server's public
# rooms directory via federation. Defaults to 'false'.
#
#allow_public_rooms_over_federation: true

# Restrict federation to the following whitelist of domains.  N.B. we recommend
# also firewalling your federation listener to limit inbound federation traffic
# as early as possible, rather than relying purely on this application-layer
# restriction.  If not specified, the default is to whitelist everything.
#
federation_domain_whitelist:
#  - lon.example.com

# Prevent federation requests from being sent to the following blacklist IP
# address CIDR ranges. If this option is not specified, or specified with an
# empty list, no ip range blacklist will be enforced.
#
# As of Synapse v1.4.0 this option also affects any outbound requests to
# identity servers provided by user input.
#
# (0.0.0.0 and :: are always blacklisted, whether or not they are explicitly
# listed here, since they correspond to unroutable addresses.)
#
federation_ip_range_blacklist:
  - '127.0.0.0/8'
  - '10.0.0.0/8'

## Homeserver blocking ##

# How to reach the server admin, used in ResourceLimitError
#
admin_contact: 'mailto:admin@$(primary_ip)'

# Global blocking
#
#hs_disabled: false
#hs_disabled_message: 'Human readable reason for why the HS is blocked'

# Whether to require a user to be in the room to add an alias to it.
# Defaults to 'true'.
#
#require_membership_for_aliases: false

# Whether to allow per-room membership profiles through the send of membership
# events with profile information that differ from the target's global profile.
# Defaults to 'true'.
#
#allow_per_room_profiles: false

# Inhibits the /requestToken endpoints from returning an error that might leak
# information about whether an e-mail address is in use or not on this
# homeserver.
# Note that for some endpoints the error situation is the e-mail already being
# used, and for others the error is entering the e-mail being unused.
# If this option is enabled, instead of returning an error, these endpoints will
# act as if no error happened and return a fake session ID ('sid') to clients.

## Database ##

  name: sqlite3
  args:
    database: /usr/local/synapse/homeserver.db


## Registration ##
#
# Registration can be rate-limited using the parameters in the 'Ratelimiting'
# section of this file.

# Enable registration for new users.
#
#enable_registration: false

# Time that a user's session remains valid for, after they log in.  By default,
# this is infinite.
#
#session_lifetime: 24h

# The user must provide all of the below types of 3PID when registering.
#
#registrations_require_3pid:
#  - email
#  - msisdn

# If set, allows registration of standard or admin accounts by anyone who
# has the shared secret, even if registration is otherwise disabled.
#
registration_shared_secret: \"$(_create_key)\"

# Allows users to register as guests without a password/email/etc, and
# participate in rooms hosted on this server which have been made
# accessible to anonymous users.
#
#allow_guest_access: false


## Metrics ###

# Enable collection and rendering of performance metrics
#
#enable_metrics: false

## Logging ##

log_config: "/etc/synapse/log_config.yaml"

## API Configuration ##

# a secret which is used to sign access tokens. If none is specified,
# the registration_shared_secret is used, if one is given; otherwise,
# a secret key is derived from the signing key.
#
macaroon_secret_key: \"$(_create_key)\"

# a secret which is used to calculate HMACs for form values, to stop
# falsification of values. Must be specified for the User Consent
# forms to work.
#
form_secret: \"$(_create_key)\"

## Signing Keys ##

# Path to the signing key to sign messages with
#
signing_key_path: \"/usr/local/synapse/synapse-archlinux.signing.key\"

# The trusted servers to download signing keys from.
#
# 'trusted_key_servers' defaults to matrix.org, but using it will generate a
# warning on start-up. To suppress this warning, set
# 'suppress_key_server_warning' to true.
#
#trusted_key_servers:
#  - server_name: \"matrix.org\"

# Uncomment the following to disable the warning that is emitted when the
# trusted_key_servers include 'matrix.org'. See above.
#
#suppress_key_server_warning: true

password_config:
   # Uncomment to disable password login
   #
   #enabled: false

   # Define and enforce a password policy. Each parameter is optional.
   # This is an implementation of MSC2000.
   #
   policy:
      # Whether to enforce the password policy.
      # Defaults to 'false'.
      #
      #enabled: true

      # Minimum accepted length for a password.
      # Defaults to 0.
      #
      #minimum_length: 15


# Uncomment to allow non-server-admin users to create groups on this server
#
#enable_group_creation: true

# If enabled, non server admins can only create groups with local parts
# starting with this prefix
#
